You can bring happiness to the people by making sure they have enough potatoes to eat, by clicking on a region name and hiring drivers to drive potatoes to another region.

If you need to raise funds, you can hire [color=yellow]fee collectors[/color] to gather party membership fees. More fee collectors, more money. For some reason that is beyond you, they don't bring the people happiness, though. If you need to slow them down, consider hiring [color=yellow]Baristas[/color]. Fee collectors love coffee.

A couple of tips we've learned from previous... regimes: Misery loves company, plans never work out the way you want, and, well, none of them seem to have survived the crushing inevitability of time...

And if you don't know what to do, just \"[color=yellow]Wait and see[/color]\" what happens!

Good luck!
